# Changelog

All notable changes to Stepover will be documented in this file.

## [0.4.0.0] - 2026-04-13

### Added
- **Pro subscribers now see their last 100 matches** in match history, instead of the last 10 that free users see.
- **Pro subscribers can review every question after any match.** Tap any match and see the question text, the correct answer, and each player's actual answer, across Duel, Battle Royale, and 2-Player modes.
- **2-Player match cells are now tappable**, opening a detail popover (Pro) or prompting to upgrade (free).
- Free users tapping a locked question section see a clear "Unlock question review with Pro" upgrade prompt that opens the existing subscription sheet.

### Changed
- Battle Royale matches now persist each player's answers per question, so post-match review shows what you answered and whether it was correct.
- Duel matches now persist each player's typed answer, so both players can see what the other actually entered.
- Match history endpoint now authenticates the requester; viewing another user's profile returns the standard (non-Pro) match list depth regardless of the viewer's subscription.

### Fixed
- Previously, stripped question payloads could leak to free clients through the nested `detail_snapshot` field. Questions are now stripped server-side at every level before the response is sent.

## [0.3.3.0] - 2026-04-13

### Changed
- **Share buttons now open the native iOS/Android share sheet** instead of the browser's Web Share fallback, so duel, online 1v1, and Battle Royale invites flow through the OS share UI users expect.
- **Invite messages now include a tap-to-open deep link plus a copy-paste code**, so recipients can either tap the link (if installed) or paste the code into the app.

### Fixed
- Sharing no longer dumps the invite text into the clipboard when the user cancels the share sheet.
- Recipients no longer see the invite link appear twice in WhatsApp/iMessage previews.

### Added
- `stepovr://` URL scheme registered on iOS and Android. Tapping `stepovr://duel/CODE`, `stepovr://game/CODE`, `stepovr://br/CODE`, or `stepovr://invite` opens the app and routes to the matching screen.

## [0.3.2.0] - 2026-04-13

### Changed
- **Consistent back button across all screens** — lobbies (Online 1v1, Duel, Battle Royale), Notifications, Terms, Privacy, and Match Details now share a single header component with identical styling, touch-target size, and icon rendering.
- **Duel lobby now has a back button** — previously the only lobby without one.

### Fixed
- Online 1v1 lobby back arrow now renders correctly (previously the arrow icon was invisible due to a font-subset mismatch).
- Bottom navigation now auto-hides during active gameplay across Solo Ranked, Blitz, Mayhem, and Daily — preventing accidental taps that could abort a timed question. Previously only Logo Quiz had this behavior.

## [0.3.1.0] - 2026-04-12

### Changed
- **Online 1v1 lobby redesign** — rebuilt to match the premium lobby pattern used across the app. New hero image, atmospheric spotlight lighting, glass-surface active-game cards, and a bottom sheet for Create / Random Opponent / Join-by-Code actions.
- Restored back button in the top nav
- Active-game cards now show turn status with clearer color-coded badges (Your Turn / Their Turn / Waiting / Queued)

### Added
- Empty state on the online lobby when you have no active games
- Dedicated `/online-mode.png` hero asset (decoupled from the duel image)

### Fixed
- Long opponent usernames now truncate with ellipsis instead of breaking the card layout
- Bottom sheet is now keyboard-accessible: Escape dismisses, focus is trapped inside while open, and focus returns to the trigger on close
- All contrast ratios now meet or exceed WCAG AA (most AAA)
- Reverted an over-broad `.gitignore` rule (`docs/*`) that would have excluded project documentation

## [0.3.0.0] - 2026-04-12

### Added
- **XP & Leveling system** — earn XP on every correct and wrong answer, streak bonuses up to +30 for 15+ consecutive correct, +50 on duel wins, +75 on Battle Royale wins, +20 on Solo session completion, +15 on Blitz round completion, and +25 for your daily streak. Level up with an animated celebration overlay.
- Level badge in the top-nav next to Solo/Logo/W-L chips
- XP progress bar on the profile page showing progress to next level and total XP earned
- Floating "+XP" gain feedback in Solo mode (with separate styling for streak bonuses)
- `profiles.xp` and `profiles.level` columns, plus new `xp_history` audit table
- Server-side `award_xp` RPC with atomic row-lock, search_path hardening, and service-role-only execute

### Changed
- `updateDailyStreak` now centrally awards the daily-streak XP once per day across all game modes (not just Solo)
- Solo and Mayhem sessions track a dedicated `consecutiveCorrect` counter for accurate streak bonuses (resets on wrong/timeout)

## [0.2.0.0] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- **Online 2-Player Board Game** — play the full 7x5 board game remotely with a friend via invite code, with live spectating of your opponent's turn including wrong attempts and Top 5 slot fills in real-time
- Backend OnlineGameService with full game lifecycle: create, join, ready-up, select question, answer, Top 5 guessing, 50-50 lifeline, and turn timeout cron
- REST API at /api/online-games with 12 endpoints (all auth-guarded)
- Supabase Realtime subscriptions for live opponent state sync
- Spectating view: see opponent's question, wrong answer attempts, and Top 5 progress as they play

- Turn timeout cron (2-minute turns, 5-minute check interval with Redis lock)
- ELO ranking legend overlay on leaderboard page, auto-shown on first visit
- Force-update banner system with soft and hard update modes
- Wrong-shake animation on incorrect answers across all game modes

### Changed
- LLM model names moved from hardcoded constants to environment-configurable properties
- Logo quiz header and news mode UX improvements

### Fixed
- Replaced test AdMob App ID with production credentials to fix crash on launch
- Top 5 meta data stripped from spectating player's view to prevent answer leaking
- Race condition in continueToBoard where both players clearing result simultaneously could cause one to miss it

## [0.1.1.0] - 2026-04-08

- Tag color variants use shared tokens (was 70+ hard-coded hex values)
- Fluid typography via clamp() on hero and 2-player titles

### Fixed
